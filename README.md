### Extract schema from BigQuery table using BigQuery SQL

1. Use the sql code in BigQuery Editor and specify the dataset and table name for which a JSON schema needs to be generated.
2. Copy the result to clipboard and paste in your IDE.

This would come in handy to extract schema for pre-existing tables in .json format (STRUCT in BigQuery).
##### Work Around: Make sure to replace the double double-quotes using your preferred IDE's replace text feature. If your IDE is missing it then you should probably consider switching to VS Code ;)
